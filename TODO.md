1. finish first pass in review_loop (300 of 500 completed currently)
2. apply category changes where marked in review_loop

3. filter through suspicious categories
    - short loops (-> fills)
    - long percussion (-> fills)

4. figure out what to do with vocals
    - ideas:
        - 'throws' category for melodic throws/vocals? and/or 'chops' for melodic, bursty sounds?
        - 'lyrics' instead of vocal_shots
